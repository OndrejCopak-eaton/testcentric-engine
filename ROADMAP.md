# TestCentric "Roadmap"

Speed of development of the TestCentric GUI varies as contributors have more or less time available and as various new needs are discovered. That's why we put "Roadmap" in quotes. Nevertheless, at any point in time, we do know what we are working on, what we expect to work on next and what we hope to work on in the more distant future.

This roadmap was updated on 16 November 2019. "Near Term" means through 2019. "Medium Term" means the first quarter of 2020. "Long Term" means the rest of 2020. Of course, it all depends on who is available to work on the project and one way to accelerate development in the areas that interest you is to volunteer!

## Near Term

 * Backend Improvements
   - Remove dependency on NUnit Engine
   - Support running tests under .NET Core
   - Save and restore `TestPackages`.
 * GUI Improvements
   - Minor standard GUI enhancements
   - Bring Experimental GUI up to same feature set as standard GUI.

## Medium Term
 * Backend Improvements
   - Support for additional test platforms
 * GUI Improvements
   - Limited Enhancements to version 1.x - defer most to version 2
 * Version 2.0
   - Select technology (e.g. WPF, Xamarin, other) for version 2 of the GUI
   - Experiment with Visual Studio integration (adapter? extension?)
   - Create project and start work

## Long Term
 * Version 2.0 GUI Release
   - Continued support for Version 1.x through the year
 * TestCentric extension and / or adapter for Visual Studio
 * TestCentric console runner
 * TestCentric framework
